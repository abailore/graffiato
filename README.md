Real time collaborative paint tool, built using HTML5 canvas, Node js and Socket.io

Learning Node.js and wanted to build a simple app. Used the below tutorial to get things running. Made changes to it to work like a collaborative paint tool.

Steps to run the program

1) Install node (eg. do brew install node on Mac)
2) Do - node game.js to start the server
3) Open public/index.html file in the browser and play around with arrow keys
4) Open the index.html file in another window and keep both windows open side by side and start drawing on one window and see the magic!

More changes coming soon!
